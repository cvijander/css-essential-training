# CSS Essential Training – Christina Truong (LinkedIn Learning)

🧠 This is one of my **earliest CSS practice repositories**, created while I was actively following the CSS Essential Training course on LinkedIn Learning by Christina Truong.

At the time, my goal was to learn the fundamentals of CSS step-by-step and document everything by practicing directly in HTML files and small experiments.

## 📁 What's inside?

This repo includes:

- `1.html` – my first test with basic CSS structure
- `Font size px, em, rem/` – folder with examples using different CSS units
- `other stuff/` – miscellaneous practice code
- `personal-site/` – very early experiments with layout and colors

All files were created while following the course lessons.

## 💬 Why this repo matters?

I’m keeping this repository public to show my learning process — not just the final result.  
It’s a **snapshot** of where I started when I first encountered CSS seriously.
